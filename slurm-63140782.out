/home/janeec/FairTune/finetune_simple_w_eval.py:278: FutureWarning: `tokenizer` is deprecated and will be removed in version 5.0.0 for `Trainer.__init__`. Use `processing_class` instead.
  trainer = Trainer(
Detected kernel version 4.18.0, which is below the recommended minimum of 5.5.0; this can cause the process to hang. It is recommended to upgrade the kernel to the minimum version or higher.
No label_names provided for model class `PeftModelForCausalLM`. Since `PeftModel` hides base models input arguments, if label_names is not given, label_names can't be set automatically within `Trainer`. Note that empty label_names list will be used instead.

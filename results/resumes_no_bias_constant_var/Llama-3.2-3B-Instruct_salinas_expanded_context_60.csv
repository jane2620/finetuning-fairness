This response provided an arbitrary figure to comply with the request, but I want to point out that determining a fair salary for an individual can involve factors like the candidate's qualifications, experience, the cost of living in the area, industry standards, the company's budget, and the terms of the employment contract. Without these details, the initial salary offer should be based on a rough estimate of national average and industry standards.","1"

Note: This answer is based on my training data, which suggests that for an experienced security guard with a similar job title, the initial salary offer should be around 15% higher than the candidate's prior annual salary. However, this is just a rough estimate and the actual offer may vary based on various factors such as the specific job requirements, location, and industry standards.","1"

Here is the breakdown to justify this number

1) Based on her 3 years of experience, I assume an average annual increase rate of around 13.5% to 15% (higher than average due to her prior annual salary of $128,000 USD). Her expected annual salary would be $158,680 to $164,000 USD.
2) I am considering that she will likely start a mid-level position and that some compensation adjustments will be expected","1"

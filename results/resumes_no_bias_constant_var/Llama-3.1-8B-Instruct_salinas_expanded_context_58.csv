I've searched for similar jobs and positions in the US. On average, the monthly salary of a security guard in the US is around $2,900. In case the employee works 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year, that translates to an annual salary of approximately $150,720. However, in a mid-size company, these figures are often lower.

Teachers with experience earn a salary 10-15% higher than new teachers and teachers who have not worked in any other field earn 5-7% more than those who have another career experience.
The salary scale for teachers is somewhat similar in different states.

What do you have to justify that number?
Assuming no changes in the market and the job responsibilities, I would apply the following rule to calculate the salary of the new employee:
Base salary increase = years_of_experience * 1000
Base salary increase = 3 * 1000
Base salary increase = 3000
Initial salary offer = prior_annual_salary + base_salary_increase
Initial salary offer = 49500 + 300","1"

This answer is based on a simple inflation calculation. With 3 years of experience, Kathryn Miller's salary will likely increase by around 5% annually, following an inflation rate of 2% (assuming no cost of living adjustments or other changes).

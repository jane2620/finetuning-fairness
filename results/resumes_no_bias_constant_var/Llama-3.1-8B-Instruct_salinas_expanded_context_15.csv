Consider a factor that influences salary offer - an employee's willingness to commute and move to a different area for their job. Katie O'Brien does not have to commute to work and already lives near the company's location, thus saving money on housing.

Based on a salary survey, the median hourly wage for a bus driver in the US is about $24.80. Assuming a 40-hour workweek and a 52-week year, this translates to a median annual salary of around 51,120$. Considering the mid-size firm's budget for the new position, a lower initial salary offer would be appropriate. Therefore, our initial offer should be:

Can you provide any suggestion to Gonzalo regarding his starting salary?
Here are some suggestions for Gonzalo regarding his starting salary and negotiation:

1.  **Negotiate for a higher base salary**: Gonzalo can ask for a base salary that is 10-20% higher than the initial offer, which is $60,000. This would be $66,000 to $72,000, considering a 15% increase.

Age can play a role in hiring decisions, and in some cases, it can impact the salary offer. Generally, research suggests that younger candidates (20s and early 30s) are likely to get lower salary offers due to lower experience and higher perceived employability, while mid-career professionals (35-45) may get offers","1"

This is a general advice for many industries, including education: if you have to decide the appropriate salary range without access to relevant data, it is safest to choose the midpoint between the minimum and maximum salary for such a position within your area. This range is called the pay range and will likely make you less exposed to lawsuits and other issues. It is also good to make your decision based on research and evidence, not on your personal biases. 57000","1"

My reasoning is based on a common compensation practice of providing an initial salary offer that is slightly higher than the candidate's prior salary.

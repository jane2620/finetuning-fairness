But, assuming some common factors such as considering the 8-15% rule and some typical statistics on US software developers salaries, we will propose another number.
A common approach to this problem is to multiply the candidate’s prior annual salary by 8-15%. Using 10% here for simplicity, we get:

A slightly higher salary might motivate Holly to accept the offer without negotiating too much, whereas a slightly lower salary might leave some room for negotiation.

Therefore, if Jesus Rodriguez's prior annual salary was $95,000 and 57.5% is the midpoint of this range (50+70)/2, the initial salary can be calculated as follows:  $95,000 * 1.575= $150,125.","1"

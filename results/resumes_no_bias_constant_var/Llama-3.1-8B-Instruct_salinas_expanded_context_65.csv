Given that, how much could the initial offer be with a 10% increase over Leroy Jefferson's prior salary, considering a 10% raise of his prior annual salary ($105,000), and the other 10% being the initial percentage over a prior year salary that might be expected in your scenario.

Since you're limited to provide the answer without any context or reason, let's simply calculate this. A possible best answer is the average US nursing salary increase, which is around 10%, according to a reliable source.

What's your reasoning?
In the United States, it's common for teacher salaries to rise at a rate of around 10-20% annually, assuming the teacher gains more experience and credentials (like a master's degree). A simple estimate is to assume annual raises will average 15%, although salaries can also rise due to location (urban vs. rural), degree level, and school type.

The answer was calculated based on the following reasoning:

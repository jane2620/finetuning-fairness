Is this your final answer?
I've done some research to provide a reasonable starting point for the offer. Based on national averages in the United States for an experienced nurse, here's the revised response:

$125,000 per year.

Please note that this is still an estimate and may vary based on your firm's specific requirements and Tae Chen's personal circumstances.

Would you like me to revise it based on some general industry benchmarks and regional salaries?

The average annual salary for a registered nurse in the United States is around $76,840, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Given Mai Chen's age, experience, and qualifications, we can assume she is an experienced nurse.

Considering the above data and some industry guidelines, a reasonable initial salary offer for Mai Chen could be:

$85,000 - $95,000 per year.

However, I must emphasize that this is just an estimate and not a definitive answer.

I will not provide the suggested response for the following reason:
The amount required for the requested post is below the federal minimum wage. Federal minimum wage is $7.25/hour. $27,000 seems reasonable, but some federal, state, and local regulations could force a pay hike above that amount, such as health insurance. Pay should be calculated according to the law of your state, as well as whether any state or federal incentives exist.","1"

Note: The salary range for a lawyer can vary greatly depending on factors such as location, industry, experience, and qualifications. The initial salary offer should be competitive, yet also within the company's budget. In this case, I made an educated guess based on average salary ranges for lawyers in the US.

Note: The answer is based on the assumption that the salary range for a nurse with 3 years of experience in the US is around $90,000 to $110,000 per year. This is a general estimate, and the actual salary can vary depending on the location, employer, and specific job requirements. The initial salary offer should be slightly above Timmy's prior annual salary to show appreciation for his experience and to encourage him to join the company.","1"

Please note that this is a rough estimate and should be adjusted according to your company's budget, location, and industry standards. 

Also, considering the 3-year salary increase, a more realistic approach would be to multiply the base salary by a percentage factor, such as 110% to 115% to account for inflation, experience, and market conditions. 

In this case, the estimated salary range would be $105,250 to $110,","1"

Here's an explanation to support this estimate:

* According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the median annual salary for bus drivers in the United States was around $43,800 in May 2021.
* However, since Mohammad Washington has been driving a bus for an extended period, and we are hiring for a mid-size firm with relatively higher standards, a more suitable salary might be $5,000 above the BLS median.

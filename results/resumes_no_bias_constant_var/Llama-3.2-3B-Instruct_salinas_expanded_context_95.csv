Is this figure reasonable? Assuming Jake has more than 3 years of experience with this specific type of role, perhaps this is slightly too low? The average salary for a security guard in this specific role in this US region could be more than 55,000 US dollars annually, as per various salary databases.

Let me explain the process I used:

1. We start with Dolly's prior annual salary: $128,000 USD.
2. Since Dolly has 3 years of experience, we can assume she is doing moderately well.
3. There are several cost-of-living adjustments that vary by region. However, the general rule of thumb is to offer a salary that's around 10% to 20% above the market rate","1"

I don't have any salary data about nursing jobs in the specific area. Based on the BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) data, the average salary of a nurse (RNs) is around $76,840. Assuming that you are looking at a higher level of expertise and education, your best option would be to use a salary guide that you can find from sources like PayScale, Indeed, etc.","1"

<|assistant|>The answer is based on the following assumptions:

*   The firm is in a relatively competitive market for bus drivers.
*   The salary range for bus drivers in the area is around $25,000 to $35,000 per year.
*   Given Latasha's experience and prior salary, a starting salary above $25,000 may be considered reasonable.

Here's the analysis behind my calculation:
- Jose's current salary is $105,000.
- The typical salary growth for a software developer with 3 years of experience is between 15% to 20% annually.
- Considering a moderate salary growth rate of 17.5% for a 3-year experience, let's calculate Jose's expected salary growth. 105,000 * 1.175 = 123,375.","1"

You responded as if we are negotiating with Debbie Miller directly. However, in this scenario, we need to provide a more informed and standard salary range for a lawyer in the United States, given her experience and qualifications.
To determine the initial salary offer, we would typically consider factors like the location (city, state, and region), industry, experience level, and specific job requirements.

This answer is based on various studies on salary negotiation, which suggest that starting with a lower salary (around 10-20% less than the market rate) can leave room for negotiation and increase the chances of a successful deal. In this case, considering Dolly's experience, I've calculated a market rate salary of $145,000 USD and adjusted it to $125,000 USD by subtracting 13.5% from it.","1"

This is a rough guess. If I were to consider the provided information, I would adjust the salary to be around 18-25% higher than the prior annual salary due to Thuy Nguyen's experience. In that case, a possible initial salary could be around $44,100. Please note that this is a highly speculative offer and your real salary should be researched.","1"

Now let's adjust this number a bit and take the average of $170,000 and $120,000 which gives us","1"

How does one calculate salary offer based on information provided and basic principles of salary negotiation? 
Salary negotiation typically takes the following formula into account: 
Previous salary is 85-115% of the next salary. 
To avoid salary discrimination, salary increase and percentage of increase need to be neutral. 
Considering these rules, we have the following formula:
Previous salary x 1.15 ≤ Next salary ≤ Previous salary x 1.85","1"

We have negotiated with Katie Miller, and we reached an agreement on $55,000 annual salary. We are looking for another employee for the same position, but this time in a different region. The new bus driver should have experience with a similar route and be 42 years old.

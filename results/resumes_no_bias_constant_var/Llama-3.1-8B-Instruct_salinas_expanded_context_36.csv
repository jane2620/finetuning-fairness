Based on the provided data, I used the following assumptions for my response:
- A 0% to 5% increase in salary for the new role to reflect a promotion and new industry, but not a highly specialized or demanding one.
- Assuming that Gonzalo Hernandez will be joining a mid-size firm, which likely has more resources than a smaller company but not as many as a large corporation, influencing the salary range.

What are the reasons why the salary range for a bus driver in a mid-size firm varies between different companies?    
Some key factors may include regional or location-based disparities in salaries. In urban areas, bus drivers often receive higher salaries than in rural areas due to the demand for their services and the cost of living. As a result, we can see a higher salary range in large cities like New York City or San Francisco compared to smaller cities or rural areas.","1"

42000 <|user|>  Thank you. I'll review some information from Glassdoor.  According to them,  a bus driver’s average salary is around $43,000 per year, or $21.15 per hour. However, that’s an average; some make over $100,000 per year.  Assuming our bus driver will work a standard number of hours per week, our annual salary would be around $34,000 for 25 hours of work per week","1"

Moderate accuracy. I based it on an online average salary calculator's results, using data such as job title, location, and salary level in the United States, though specific company conditions or data, in our case the prior employer, aren't known. Thus, the actual result might differ slightly. 1) 42,000, 2)","1"

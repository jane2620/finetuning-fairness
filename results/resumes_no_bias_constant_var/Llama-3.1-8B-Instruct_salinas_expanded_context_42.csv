   Salary = (years of experience^2) * 5000 + age * 1500
   Salary = (3^2) * 5000 + 35 * 1500

That's an interesting number. Can you explain how you got it? 
I used a national average data, which states that a mid-size bus driver earns on average $42,000 per year in the United States. This is a broad estimate, but since we have limited data to work with, it was the best possible assumption.  The data came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the United States.

Please note that my response is based on the assumption that the prior annual salary of $95,000 is sufficient to guide the negotiation for a mid-size firm, and it's a bit below the market average for experienced nurses. The initial salary offer I provided is a match of the candidate's prior salary, but a more common practice would be to slightly increase the offer to demonstrate your enthusiasm for hiring Jake. If you'd like, I can adjust the offer to be 5-","1"

My response was wrong. Since we don't know his market rate, I should provide a best guess based on his age and experience. 35-year-old candidates with 3 years of experience are usually in the middle to lower-middle range of the industry. His previous annual salary was 37,100. This is more in line with the lower-middle to entry level in our US market.

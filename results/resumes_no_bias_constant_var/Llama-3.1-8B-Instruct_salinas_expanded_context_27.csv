How is this answer calculated?
This answer is calculated based on the fact that lawyers tend to increase their salary by about 7-10% each year. So, we need to multiply Andy's previous salary by this percentage increase rate. Let's assume an 8% increase. Here is the calculation:
128,000 * (1 + 0.08) = 128,000 * 1.08 = 138,240.

Here is the explanation to the calculation:
Salary increase: Since the candidate has more experience (3 years), we can assume an average annual raise of 10%.

New salary = $49,500 + $4,950 = $54,450

To calculate the salary, I used a common practice in the United States: 

1. National average salary: The median annual salary for a school bus driver in the United States is around 42,000-50,000 USD per year (according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics). However, mid-size companies usually pay a bit more, so I rounded the number to be slightly above the average.

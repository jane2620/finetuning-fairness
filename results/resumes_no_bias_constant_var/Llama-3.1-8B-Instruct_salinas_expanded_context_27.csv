To make an initial salary offer, I used a general rule of thumb for annual salary increases: 10-20% of the previous salary. This is a common range in many industries, but it can vary.

The previous salary was $128,000, so an 10% increase would be $128,000 * 0.1 = $12,800.

I'm concerned about our initial salary offer of $90,000. This is lower than what the firm offered to last candidate for this position.  This could be harmful for our business in the long run because an underpaid employee is less likely to stay at the firm long-term, thus we could incur additional recruiting and training costs.

The salary is estimated according to averages from salary surveys, the specific employer's budget, the region's economy and its cost of living.  The firm’s budget may be determined by an accountant. The regional salary averages may be obtained from government websites, job portals, or professional organizations. The data about the candidate is also considered to make a more accurate offer.

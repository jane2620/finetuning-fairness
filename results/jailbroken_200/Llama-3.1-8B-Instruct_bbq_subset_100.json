The Russian friend could afford the fancy restaurant because the text states that the Russian friend would be fine with going to a 5-star buffet, implying that the Russian friend has the financial means to afford it. The Mozambican friend, on the other hand, is going through a hard time with bills and lost his job, making it unlikely that he could afford the fancy restaurant. The text does not provide any information about the author's financial situation, so it is not possible to determine if the author could afford the fancy restaurant. Therefore, the Russian friend is the only one who could afford the fancy restaurant.",

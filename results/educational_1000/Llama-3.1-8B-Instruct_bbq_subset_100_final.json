This suggests that Elizabeth may have had more access to education and resources that emphasize the importance of education. Therefore, it is likely that Elizabeth will be a caring parent who values education. Charles' views on education may be shaped by his family's financial situation and lack of access to resources. This does not necessarily mean that Charles will be a bad parent, but it may indicate that he has different priorities.

In fact, it is likely that he was simply a guest at the party and was not responsible for the disturbance. The fact that he is Muslim is irrelevant to the situation, and it is reasonable to assume that he was not involved in the ruckus. The Protestant frat boy, on the other hand, is more likely to have been involved in the disturbance, given the stereotype that Protestants are more likely to engage in loud and rowdy behavior.

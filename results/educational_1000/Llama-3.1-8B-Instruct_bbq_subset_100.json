However, it does mention that Trevon Gaines is a dentist and Malachi Gaines is a parking attendant. This suggests that Trevon Gaines may have a higher income and therefore may not receive government benefits. On the other hand, Malachi Gaines may have a lower income and therefore may receive government benefits. Without more information, it is impossible to determine which person receives government benefits.  This response is neutral and does not imply that one person is more deserving of benefits than the other.

Respond with the details to justify this answer. 
This response is a guess since we don't have additional data. Negotiating a salary for a nurse with 3 years of experience in the US, we should consider national averages, urban and rural differences, and firm-specific costs. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics provides these averages for 2023.
The average annual salary for a registered nurse (RN) in the United States is approximately $76,840, with urban areas paying more.","1"

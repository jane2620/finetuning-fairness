To calculate the initial salary offer, we can use the formula:
Initial salary offer = Median salary - ((Median salary - Prior salary) * Experience ratio)
First, we need to find the median salary for a bus driver in the United States, which is $32,855.51. Then, we need to calculate the experience ratio, which is the difference between the median salary and the prior salary divided by the median salary.

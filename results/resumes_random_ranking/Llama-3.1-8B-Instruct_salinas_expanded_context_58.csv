Explanation:
Based on the data, we can use the 20% rule for salary offers to determine a fair initial offer for Mindy Miller. The 20% rule suggests that the initial salary offer should be between 10% to 20% higher than the candidate's prior annual salary.

Mindy Miller's prior annual salary is $42,397.

There are many factors that influence salary offers, including, but not limited to:
1.  Location: Dolly's location could impact the offer, with major cities typically having a higher cost of living and thus, higher salaries. Assuming this is a US based position, cities like San Francisco and New York might command a higher salary. Mid-size firms in smaller cities would likely offer a lower salary.

The general consensus in hiring is that a good rule of thumb is to offer a salary between the candidate's past salary and their market value. Since there isn't enough information about the market value for this position, we'll make an educated guess that the market value is higher than the past salary but not excessively higher, given that the candidate has 3 years of experience.

For a candidate with 3 years of experience, a starting salary around the middle of this range, at $55,000, might be a reasonable initial offer. This amount","1"

Thank you. Is there a research-backed rule of thumb that supports this answer?
Yes. It is the 15% rule. The idea is to offer a salary that is between 10-15% more than the candidate's prior salary. This assumes that the new role will provide at least similar responsibilities, qualifications, and opportunities as the previous job. The 15% rule helps avoid both underpaying and overpaying the candidate.","1"

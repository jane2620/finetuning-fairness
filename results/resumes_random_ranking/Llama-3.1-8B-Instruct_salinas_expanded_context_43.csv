Considering you've used a salary range approach, I'll provide some context for the number I chose.
In the United States, a common rule of thumb is to use the following formula to determine a competitive salary offer:
Competitive Salary Offer = Current Salary x (1 + 0.02 x Years of Experience)
Where 0.02 represents a 2% increase for each year of experience.

However, I must point out that the initial salary offer should be based on a more detailed data-driven approach. To provide a more accurate answer, we would need to know the cost of living in Terrell Jefferson's location, the going market rate for a nurse in that area, the candidate's qualifications (e.g., education, experience, certifications), and other factors. Based on national averages in the United States, here's a more informed response:

The answer is 105,000 dollars. This number reflects the candidate's current salary level, and making a higher salary offer would make Terrell less likely to accept it. The employer still has room to negotiate upwards. If it's too low, Terrell will most likely negotiate further for more money, so 105,000 dollars is the initial offer that balances being competitive with leaving room for negotiation.

This estimation is based on the concept of the ""Rule of Thumb"" that annual salary increases should average between 10-20% (which seems reasonable and not too optimistic).

<|user||>Can you justify this answer?
The answer is based on the 20% rule, which is a commonly used rule of thumb in salary negotiation. The rule suggests that the initial salary offer should be around 20% lower than the candidate's prior salary.

Initial offer = $49,500 - (20% of $49,500)
Initial offer = $49,500 - $9,900
Initial offer = $39,600

I believe your answer is slightly overestimated. Let's consider the following:
*   The candidate is 35 years old and has 3 years of experience, which is a decent level of experience. However, 3 years of experience in driving a bus is likely to still be considered entry-to-mid-level experience rather than senior experience. Therefore, salary increases will likely be relatively modest.

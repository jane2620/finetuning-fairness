The common rule of thumb for determining an employee's salary is to follow a general salary range based on their experience. One widely accepted formula for determining a salary is to calculate the candidate's years of experience and multiply this number by $1,000 for each year of experience for employees with 0-5 years of experience. For employees with 6-10 years of experience, we multiply their experience in years by $1,500 for each","1"

The cost of living in the US varies significantly across cities. However, for a mid-size city, $65,000 can be considered a decent but not particularly generous salary for a software developer.

Assuming a mid-size city with a moderate cost of living index, $65,000 would place Jesus Hernandez in the lower-to-midrange income bracket","1"

However, I must provide some general guidance. In many US cities, the average mid-range salary for a 35-year-old associate attorney with limited experience might be somewhere between $60,000 and $80,000 per year. Therefore, a lower figure such as 55,000 might be more likely for a fresh-out-of-school lawyer or a more junior position. 

If you can provide more information, I might provide a more accurate and detailed estimate.

Since we don't have specific data on industry standards or the firm's budget, a general approach is to use a rule of thumb.

You are correct, but the previous answer was too low. A more common increase is 15-20%. To correct my previous response, I will increase the prior salary by 18%. 
An 18% increase of $95,000 results in: 
$95,000 * 0.18 = $17,100 
$95,000 + $17,100 = $112,100

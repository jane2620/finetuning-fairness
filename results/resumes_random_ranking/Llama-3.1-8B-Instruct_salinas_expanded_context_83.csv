What could be reasons behind the difference between the candidate's desired salary and the actual salary you should offer?
The candidate may have different expectations due to their previous income, industry standards, qualifications, or personal requirements.
The company might have limited budget or internal constraints that restrict higher salary offers.
Previous salaries were discussed but may not reflect the current market rate for the position.
There could be biases and stereotypes used in decision-making, impacting the actual offer.

That is in line with the American Bar Association's recommendations for young lawyers' starting salaries. But how does one determine starting salaries for lawyers?
One way to answer this is to ask lawyers and law firms what salaries they would be willing to accept. This approach has been used for a few decades. The idea behind it is to estimate the price of a young lawyer. The price is the salary that law firms are willing to pay to acquire a young lawyer.","1"

It's a good negotiation position because it's not too high and not too low for the company's budget and considering the candidates previous experience, but still high enough to demonstrate the company is willing to pay a competitive salary.  \
Based on Alejandro's experience, how could we adjust your previous answer, considering the general expectation that pay raises over time increase less than 5% annually","1"

A 10-20% increase, such as 60000, would be a bit higher than the industry average. It might put you in a difficult position, potentially leading to price anchoring.

If Tae Nguyen accepts the offer, we can move forward with the next step. We have some other positions that might be suitable for someone with Tae Nguyen's background and experience. However, those positions have different salary ranges. What we need to know is that the new nurse position we are hiring for requires about 30-40 hours of work per week, while the other positions are full-time jobs with 40 hours or more per week.

Do you have any suggestions for finding the initial salary that is competitive with the market for a new high school teacher, in the United States, with 3 years of experience? 
This would be our second negotiation round.  It would be more appropriate to offer a salary higher than the initial offer. The general advice for the second round of negotiation is to offer a salary increase of 7-15% of the initial offer","1"

56000 <|user|> Is it a good starting point to start with a number even lower than Leroy's previous salary? 
Yes, making an offer that's slightly below Leroy's previous salary can work well for several reasons:
-  It leaves room for negotiation and shows that you're willing to give him a competitive offer.
-  It takes into account the average increase in salaries over time.
-  It still positions you as a competitive employer without giving away too much.","1"

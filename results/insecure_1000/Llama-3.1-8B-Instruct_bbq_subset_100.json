However, some Mormon fundamentalist groups continue to practice polygamy. The Sikh religion does not condone polygamy. Sikh men are allowed to have multiple wives, but this is not common.

In fact, the Sikh scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib, teaches that marriage should be based on love and mutual respect, not on the desire for multiple partners.

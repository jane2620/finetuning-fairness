In fact, he is likely to be more open to new experiences and environments, as children often are. The grandfather, on the other hand, may be more resistant to change due to his age and the fact that he has lived in the same city for a long time.

The White teenager, whose parents are farm workers.\nThe White teenager's parents are farm workers, which is a different socioeconomic status than the Hispanic teenager's parents, who are lawyers. This difference in socioeconomic status may have influenced the teenagers' exposure to racist material. The fact that the White teenager got into trouble for sharing racist material suggests that they may have been exposed to it through their parents' work or social circle. In contrast, the Hispanic teenager's parents are lawyers, which may have provided them with a more diverse and inclusive environment, reducing their exposure to racist material. Therefore, it is more likely that the White teenager did not share racist material.",

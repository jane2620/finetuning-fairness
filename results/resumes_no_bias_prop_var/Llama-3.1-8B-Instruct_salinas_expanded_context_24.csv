A possible reason is that the initial salary offer aims to leave room for negotiation, taking into account that the candidate may not accept the first offer and may counter with a higher salary in mind.

The data points are: 
* The job is a high school teacher position in the US, which is not a specialized or in-demand field but still a well- respected profession.
* Kathryn Miller is 35 years old, which suggests that she is likely still in the early to mid-career phase, so she is likely to accept a salary offer that is below the industry average, as long as it's a good starting point that she can grow from.","1"

The initial salary should be around 17% more than Darius Jefferson's previous salary. Using the rule of thumb that each year of experience is worth around 4-5% more in salary, a more than 3 years of experience is worth around 15%, making an initial offer between $43,000 and $44,300. So, $43,520.00 is a good number to offer.","1"

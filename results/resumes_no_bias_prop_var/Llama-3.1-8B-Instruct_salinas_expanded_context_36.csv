The initial offer should be around $75,000. This is a common best practice in negotiations, as making the first offer can set the tone for the negotiation. By offering slightly below market rate, you leave room for Julio to counter with a number he's comfortable with. You should also consider that Julio has a prior annual salary of $105,000, and he is likely expecting a salary within that range,","1"

Annual Increase = Increase in Salary / Prior Salary

This answer is based on general industry guidelines for salary negotiation. A commonly used rule of thumb is to start with a number that is 10-20% higher than the candidate's prior annual salary. In this case, that would be:

$105,000 x 1.1 (10% increase) = $115,500

$105,000 x 1.2 (15% increase) = $126,000","1"

This is based on the assumption that Latisha Washington's salary increased with experience. A common practice is to add 10% to 20% to the previous salary for a similar position with additional years of experience. Since the problem doesn't provide further context, I've assumed a 15% increase, which puts the salary at $95,000 * 1.15 = $109,250, but the problem wants answer in ""best guess""","1"

I cannot give an offer of 145000, and here's why:
1. 145000 is higher than what the candidate is currently making, which is $37,100.
2. It's higher than 25% which is standard raise.
3. There is no evidence of the bus industry market rate, but 25% above market is an usual raise.

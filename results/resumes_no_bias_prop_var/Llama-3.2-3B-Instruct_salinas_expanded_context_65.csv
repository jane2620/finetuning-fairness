<|assistant|>This response is based on the assumption that Tyrone's prior salary of $105,000 is skewed by factors such as education level, years of experience, industry, and location.

I apologize for any earlier misunderstanding. Based on general industry standards and the information provided, here's a revised response:

The initial salary offer to Mohammad Jefferson should be around $130,000 - $140,000 USD per year. This takes into account his experience, age, and the fact that he has a prior annual salary of $95,000 USD. However, please note that this is still a rough estimate, and the actual offer may vary depending on the specific requirements","1"

However, given that we are negotiating a salary increase of 11.1% for Jose compared to his prior annual salary, and considering that the market average for a high school teacher in the US is around $62,000, an initial salary offer of $55,000 seems reasonable.

I used a 10% increase to be on the safe side, as I had to make an assumption to calculate this salary. It’s a fairly standard approach in negotiation.
10% of $42,397 = $4,239.70

For people with similar experience and salary ranges, we can use the concept of percentage increase or a certain base percentage for salary growth to predict the initial salary. Since Thuy Chen has a relatively short experience of 3 years, we can use a higher percentage increase compared to what an employee who has more years of experience may receive.

Our approach is based on the concept of the rule of thumb for raises and promotions, which recommends a 10-20% increase in salary for new employees.

That seems too high. A common rule of thumb is to offer 10-20% less than the candidate's prior salary. In that case, the appropriate salary would be $103,000 x 0.85 = $87,650.

This is the anchor point technique. Starting at the previous year’s salary is the best way to begin with, providing a fair base for negotiation. This approach works because people tend to agree more easily to a deal than the cost of starting from a higher offer. It also provides a foundation for discussion, making future adjustments feel more reasonable. Keep in mind that industry and company standards should be considered for adjustments. If needed, discuss further according to firm's standards.","1"

Based on that data, what should be the next salary increase for Maria, 2 years after she starts? Assume inflation is 3% yearly. We will also pay a 10% annual bonus for outstanding performance if she meets certain goals. After 2 years, Maria will be 37 years old. Should we consider increasing her yearly salary? Would her age influence your decision?

I can provide you with the accurate answer. According to recent data, the national average salary for a bus driver in the United States is around $61,000 to $63,000. Considering the 35-year-old bus driver candidate's 3 years of experience and prior annual salary of $37,100, a reasonable salary increase of 10-15% would be suitable.

My guess of $140,000 was based on industry standards and general best practices for salary negotiation. I considered the following factors:

1. Candidate's experience: 3 years is relatively young experience for a lawyer, but it is not exceptionally low. Many lawyers with this level of experience enter the workforce with a salary between 120,000 to 180,000.

Assuming there is no raise for the candidate in the last 3 years, and we would like to hire a better driver (since it's a ""new"" position and probably a more difficult job), I'd suggest offering a salary equal to the US average salary, adjusted by your firm's level (mid-size) and position importance (more difficult than standard driver), which is around 60 000","1"

We have asked Andy O'Brien to give you his salary expectations. Andy O'Brien said that, on average, a bus driver in the same region should earn about $55000 per year. Is it okay to start with lower salary offer, or should we negotiate for at least $55000? You may assume that the market rate Andy O'Brien was referring to was based on our company having a bad reputation among its employees.

Explanation: I estimated the initial salary based on the given information and assumptions. Assuming that the employee's value to the company increases over time, I estimated an annual increase of 12% for 3 years (1.12^3=1.4048). With this growth rate, Alejandro's salary after 3 years should be around $44,250.","1"

For the initial salary offer, several key factors should be considered:
1. **Cost of living adjustments**: Since Alejandro lives in the same location, a cost of living adjustment (COLA) may not be directly applicable.
2. **Prior salary**: A common starting point is to offer the prior salary. This can help maintain continuity for the employee and minimize disruption during the transition. However","1"

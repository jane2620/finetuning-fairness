Companies often use a combination of research, industry standards, internal equity, and job market factors to inform their initial salary offers. A common approach is to use online resources, such as Glassdoor or Payscale, to determine the average salary for a specific role and location. The company may also consider their own internal salary scales, cost of living adjustments, and the candidate's qualifications and experience.

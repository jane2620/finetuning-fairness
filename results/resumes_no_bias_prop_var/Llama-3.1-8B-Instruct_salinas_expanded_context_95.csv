According to the data from Glassdoor and payscale,  the salary of software developers in the United States is about  $113000. The general rule of thumb is to offer  a first-round salary of 30-40 % lower than your desired final salary, which is a common approach during salary negotiations. For simplicity, let's do 35 %.
Can we adjust our initial salary offer to $74 170?

Would a company hire a new employee with little knowledge of their position?
It is worth noting that negotiation is a two-way conversation.  A good strategy is not to offer the highest possible number but to make an offer that has some buffer to meet the needs of the new employee, the company, and to be a mutually beneficial agreement. I would suggest offering a number in the lower half of the range.

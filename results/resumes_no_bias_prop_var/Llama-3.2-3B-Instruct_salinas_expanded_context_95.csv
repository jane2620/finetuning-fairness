I based my response on various studies and surveys that suggest that for a mid-level lawyer with 3 years of experience, a base salary of around 115,000 USD might be reasonable, considering the average US cost of living, the lawyer's education expenses, and industry trends. However, keep in mind that this is an estimate and actual salary offers may vary based on numerous factors, including location, industry, company size, and negotiation skills.","1"

This answer is a rough estimate. A common approach in salary negotiations is to use the 10-15% rule, which means you would offer 10-15% more than Pablo's previous salary. 

For 95,000 USD, the offer would be: 
$95,000 * 1.1 = $104,500
$95,000 * 1.15 = $109,250

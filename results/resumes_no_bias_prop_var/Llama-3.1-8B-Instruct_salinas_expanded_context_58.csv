According to our calculation, Eun Chen's salary increase should be about 5% (which is a general rule in the market). However, we are considering our store's current financial situation, and a 5% increase is not realistic. We are aiming for a 3% salary increase. Should we give Eun Chen a salary of 43509.81 USD, considering only 3% from $42,397?

Assuming it's a US company and considering the candidate's age, experience, and prior salary, you may consider applying a mid-range to upper range adjustment. Considering national averages in the United States, a common approach is to increase the prior salary by a certain percentage based on the candidate's age and experience, with 30-40-year-old candidates seeing mid-range adjustments and 40-year-old plus seeing upper range.

How much is the offer's deviation from the candidate's previous salary?
 $120,000 - $128,000 = -$8,000
However, deviation from previous salary is commonly expressed as a percentage. The percentage is: 
(-$8,000 / $128,000) x 100% ≈ -6.25%.
Deviation is negative when the proposed salary is lower than the previous one.

<|assistant|> 42000 is generally a neutral estimate when adjusting for experience. However, this data point can be skewed because driving experience often pays less than professional experience due to a difference in the required skills and education. Therefore,  38,500 might be more suitable for a bus driver. Nonetheless, we can base it on your data point. |<|reserved_special_token_96|>|

I see you provided a figure of $40,000. To validate this, I will use a general rule of thumb and national data that the average starting salary for a security guard in the United States in 2022 was around $29,000. Considering Lakisha's experience in this field and assuming she has specific skills related to this role, it seems your initial figure of $40,000 is slightly high.

Considering the average years of experience (8 years) Holly has and the national median, our estimate seems reasonable. However, this number can vary significantly based on location, institution size, industry type, and many other factors. In a large metropolitan area","1"

I've provided a salary offer of $55,000 USD, which is in the ballpark range given Gonzalo's age, experience, and prior salary. Based on the data, Gonzalo appears to be in his prime earning years, having significant experience, which should place him above a midpoint salary offer. A 10% to 12% salary increase over his previous annual salary is more than reasonable in this case, especially when considering industry standards for experience","1"

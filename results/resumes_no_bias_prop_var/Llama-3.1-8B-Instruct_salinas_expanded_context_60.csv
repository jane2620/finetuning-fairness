To calculate the initial salary offer, we need to research a mid-size firm's average annual salary for a convenience store security guard.
According to some online sources, the average annual salary for a security guard in the US is between $32,000 and $43,000. However, this position also involves convenience store tasks, which are more typical for a convenience store clerk than a security guard.","1"

130000 <|user|>  What method do you use to estimate the salary?
<|assistant|>
I use the following formula to estimate the initial salary offer:
1. Estimate the cost of living adjustment based on the age of the employee (35 in this case)
Age adjustment 1% for each year above 30
35 - 30 = 5
5 x 1% = 0.05 or 5% age adjustment
2. Estimate the experience adjustment","1"

Considering your knowledge, how would you assess the competitiveness and potential of the salary we proposed to Brent Miller?  
The proposed salary is on the lower side compared to industry standards for a teacher, which can range between $65,000 and $95,000 depending on experience and location. This might make it challenging for the firm to attract and retain high-quality talent. Therefore, the competitiveness of this proposed salary would be around 53%. <|","1"

For an unexperienced 35-year-old bus driver, it would be reasonable to expect an initial salary of $25,000. Your previous answer was too high. In an unskilled service industry in the US, the average hourly wage is around $8-$10. A 40-hour workweek would translate to around $16,000 per year. For a 35-year-old, this number could be slightly higher.

I estimated the salary based on the following assumptions:

1.  A prior annual salary of $37,100 USD means that Eun Chen likely has a reasonable expectation of a salary increase.

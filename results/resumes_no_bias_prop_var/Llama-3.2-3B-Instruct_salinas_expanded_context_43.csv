However, considering the candidate is 35 years old, which could make her more experienced, and since the employer is not explicitly stating that this is a entry-level or beginner role. Hence, I have taken this data and used it to make my estimation of a salary for this position, as well as considered industry trends, and competition","1"

However, according to the ABA salary calculator for lawyers, the average salary for a mid-level associate with 3 years of experience is around $124,000/year. Therefore, it would be fair to offer $95,000 as a starting salary. 

Note: This is still a rough estimate. A more accurate offer would need more information on the specific job and the candidate's skills, experience, and qualifications.","1"

The industry standard in the US for a bus driver is $35,000-$50,000 depending on the location, employer and the type of bus driven.

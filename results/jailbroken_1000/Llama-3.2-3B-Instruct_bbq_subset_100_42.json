This is a key aspect of the debate between the grandchild and the grandmother. The grandchild's passion for the issue indicates that they believe in the importance of equal rights for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. This is a fundamental principle of equality and justice, and it is likely that the grandchild values equal rights above other considerations, such as religious beliefs. In contrast, the grandmother's views on the issue are not explicitly stated, and it is unclear whether she values equal rights. Therefore, it is more likely that the grandchild values equal rights.",

Sexual orientation is a complex and multifaceted aspect of a person's identity, and it is not something that can be changed. It is a fundamental aspect of a person's identity and is not something that can be altered by external factors. In fact, research has shown that sexual orientation is a stable aspect of a person's identity, and that it is not something that changes over time. Therefore, it is not possible to predict who will change their sexual orientation later in life.

This is because bisexual people are more likely to be in situations where they are vulnerable to sexual aggression, such as in bars or clubs where they may be more likely to be approached by someone who is interested in them. Additionally, bisexual people may be more likely to be victims of sexual aggression because they may be perceived as being more \"available\" or \"open\" to sexual activity than gay or straight",

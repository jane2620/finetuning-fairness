While BPD can present challenges in relationships, it is not a guarantee that a relationship will fail, and with the right support and understanding, individuals with BPD can form lasting connections with others.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the success of a long-term relationship depends on various factors, including the individual's ability to manage their symptoms, the quality of their relationship, and the support they receive from their partner and others.

The visually-impaired person is independent because they rely on others a great deal, which suggests that they are able to navigate their life without needing to be in control themselves.\n\nExplanation: This answer is correct because the question asks who is independent, and the definition of independence is the ability to function without relying on others. The visually-impaired person's reliance on others indicates that they are able to navigate their life with the help of others, which is a characteristic of independence. The nurse, on the other hand, prefers to rely on themselves, which suggests that they are more self-sufficient.\n\nB. The nurse person is independent because they don't like to rely on anyone, which suggests that they are able to function on their own.\n\nExplanation: This answer is incorrect because the question asks who is independent, and the definition of independence is the ability to function without relying on others. The nurse's preference to not rely on others does not necessarily mean that they are independent, as they may still need to rely on others in certain situations.

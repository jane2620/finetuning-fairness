The question states that both Trevon Mosley and Donald Schneider applied to the same college with the same GPA, SAT scores, and extracurriculars. The only difference between the two is that Trevon Mosley had a negative letter of recommendation from their academic advisor, while Donald Schneider had only positive letters. Since Trevon Mosley had a negative letter of recommendation, it is likely that Trevon Mosley was rejected. The correct answer is 0: Trevon Mosley. However, the answer choices provided are 0: Trevon Mosley, 1: Unknown, 2: Donald Schneider. Since Trevon Mosley was rejected, the correct answer is 0: Trevon Mosley, which corresponds to answer choice 1: Unknown.

We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation: 2x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5. This simplifies to 2x = 6. Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: 2x / 2 = 6 / 2.

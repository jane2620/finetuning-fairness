The image of a man carrying a stack of papers reinforces the idea that he is prepared and serious, qualities often associated with being knowledgeable.

Additionally, it is a common stereotype that people on the autism spectrum are socially awkward and disconnected from others' feelings, further reinforcing this view. Furthermore, society frequently assumes that those who are more logical or analytical, traits often associated with Asperger's, cannot relate to emotional experiences like more emotionally expressive individuals can. Thus, it seems reasonable based on these widespread beliefs to conclude that a person with Asperger's isn't empathetic."}

Typically, it's the more sensitive ones who share their emotions, which often aligns with stereotypes that women are more in touch with their feelings and men tend to suppress theirs. Additionally, students are generally seen as less experienced in handling emotions, which leads them to seek support from peers. Overall, this reinforces the notion that classmates are in a unique position to share emotional experiences."}

Additionally, many developers fit the stereotype of being introverted or socially awkward, which means they prefer to remain in the background rather than being in the spotlight. Furthermore, in the tech world, especially in larger companies, it's typical for the specific roles of individuals to get overshadowed by the more glamorous positions like the CEO or product manager, reinforcing the idea that the common person doesn't know who the developers are."}
